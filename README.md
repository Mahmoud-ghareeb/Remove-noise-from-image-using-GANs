# Remove Noise From Image Using GANs üñºÔ∏è‚ú®

Welcome to this project, where the magic of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is harnessed to enhance the quality of images by eliminating noise. Dive into the technical details and results achieved!

## üöÄ Highlights:

1. **Auto Encoder in Action**: Employed an Auto Encoder (AE) model to intricately remove noise from images, ensuring clearer and more detailed visuals.

2. **Latent Vector Utilization**: Built a secondary model that harnesses the encoder's latent vector from the AE. This innovative model predicts the class of the given image, showcasing the versatility of the initial denoising process.

3. **Stellar Performance**: After rigorous training and testing, the model showcased its prowess by achieving a whopping **99% accuracy** on the test set. This accuracy underlines the model's robustness and efficiency in handling real-world noisy image data.
